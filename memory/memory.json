If yes, we can visualize the number of Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered individuals over time. Additionally, we can calculate relevant metrics such as the final size of the outbreak, basic reproduction number, and time needed for the disease to die out. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the analysis.",

This maximum infection occurred at one of the timesteps within the 250 total rows in the data, but the specific timestep is not provided in the summary.\n\nOn average, there were approximately 261.96 infected individuals across the 250 timesteps and 50 simulation runs. The dataset also shows that a total of 24,412 individuals recovered from the simulated epidemic. Lastly, the average number of susceptible individuals throughout the simulation was around 461.85."
