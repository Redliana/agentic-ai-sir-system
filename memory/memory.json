If you'd like, I can provide a summary of key findings, such as the final number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, the peak of infections, the reproduction number R0, and the basic reproduction number R_effective. Please let me know if you're interested in seeing these results or if you'd like to see something specific.",

This maximum infection occurred at one of the timesteps within the 250 total rows in the data, but the specific timestep is not provided in the summary.\n\nOn average, there were approximately 261.96 infected individuals across the 250 timesteps and 50 simulation runs. The dataset also shows that a total of 24,412 individuals recovered from the simulated epidemic. Lastly, the average number of susceptible individuals throughout the simulation was around 461.85."
